# Poke Toolkit

A modular, emotionally intelligent React app powered by Redux Toolkit  
_Built for onboarding clarity, UI empathy, and scalable architecture._

## Description

Poke Toolkit is a **modular and emotionally intelligent** React application that lets users browse Pokémon data via the PokéAPI. It demonstrates best practices in frontend development, including Redux Toolkit for **scalable state management**, performance optimization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`, and a **responsive UI built with reusable, teachable components**.

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase **onboarding-friendly architecture**, **editorial clarity**, and **emotionally aware UI feedback** using modern React tools.

### **Key Features**

- **Paginated Pokémon browsing** with smooth transitions.
- **Interactive Pokémon cards** with official artwork and names.
- **Global state management** using Redux Toolkit slices and thunks.
- **Efficient API handling** with Axios and error fallback.
- **Custom hooks** for clean, reusable data-fetching logic.
- **Accessible UI feedback** with loading spinners and error messages.
- **Modular components** designed for onboarding and editorial clarity.

This project is part of my portfolio to **demonstrate scalable, maintainable frontend development** using modern React tools.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Component-based user interface.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool and development server.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Simplified global state management.
- **React Redux:** Official React bindings for Redux.
