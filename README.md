# Poke Toolkit

### A modular, emotionally intelligent React app powered by Redux Toolkit

## Description

Poke Toolkit is a **modular and emotionally intelligent** React application that lets users browse Pokémon data via the PokéAPI. It demonstrates best practices in frontend development, including Redux Toolkit for **scalable state management**, performance optimization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`, and a **responsive UI built with reusable, teachable components**.

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase **onboarding-friendly architecture**, **editorial clarity**, and **emotionally aware UI feedback** using modern React tools.

### **Key Features**

- **Optimized Pokémon browsing** with paginated data.
- **Interactive Pokémon cards** displaying images and names.
- **Improved modal performance**, ensuring smooth interactions.
- **Global state management** with Redux Toolkit.
- **Efficient API handling** using Axios.
- **Custom hooks** for clean and reusable data-fetching logic.

This project is part of my portfolio to **demonstrate scalable, maintainable frontend development** using modern React tools.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Component-based user interface.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool and development server.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Simplified global state management.
- **React Redux:** Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for API requests.
- **PropTypes:** Runtime props validation for components.
- **CSS Modules:** Component-scoped styling.
- **React.memo:** Prevents unnecessary re-renders in list components.
- **useMemo & useCallback:** Optimizes function and list rendering for better performance.
