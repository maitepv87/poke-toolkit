# Poke Toolkit

## Description

Pokémon Toolkit is a simple and clean React application that allows users to browse Pokémon data using the PokéAPI. It demonstrates key frontend development practices including Redux Toolkit for state management, Axios for API requests, and component-based architecture with a responsive UI.

This project allows users to:

- Load and browse Pokémon in paginated format.
- See each Pokémon displayed in a card with an image and name.
- Handle loading and error states with visual feedback.
- Manage global state cleanly using Redux Toolkit.
- Use a custom hook to encapsulate data-fetching logic.

This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate how to build a user-friendly, maintainable app using modern React tools.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Component-based user interface.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool and development server.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Simplified global state management.
- **React Redux:** Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Axios:** HTTP client to fetch data from APIs.
- **PropTypes:** Runtime props validation for components.
- **CSS Modules:** Component-scoped styling.
